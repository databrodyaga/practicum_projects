# Yandex Music

Using data from Yandex Music, we will compare the behavior of users in the two capitals.

**The purpose of the research** is to test three hypotheses:  
1. User activity depends on the day of the week, and this manifests differently in Moscow and St. Petersburg.  
2. On Monday mornings, certain genres prevail in Moscow, while others dominate in St. Petersburg. Similarly, different genres are predominant on Friday evenings, depending on the city.  
3. Moscow and St. Petersburg prefer different music genres. Pop music is listened to more often in Moscow, while Russian rap is more popular in St. Petersburg.

**Research process**

We will obtain user behavior data from the file `yandex_music_project.csv`. The quality of the data is unknown. Therefore, an overview of the data will be needed before testing the hypotheses.

We will check the data for errors and assess their impact on the research. Then, during the preprocessing stage, we will look for ways to correct the most critical data errors.
