# Customer Behavior Prediction for "One-Click" Online Store

## Project Description
The "One-Click" online store sells a variety of products: for children, for home, small household appliances, cosmetics, and even groceries. The store's report for the past period showed that customer activity has begun to decline. Attracting new customers is no longer as effective: most of the target audience already knows about the store. A possible solution is to maintain the activity of existing customers. This can be achieved through personalized offers.  
It is necessary to develop a solution that will allow for personalized offers to regular customers to increase their purchasing activity.


## Project Objectives
1. Develop a model that predicts the probability of a customer’s purchasing activity decreasing in the next three months.
2. Include additional financial department data on customer profitability in the study: the revenue each customer generated for the company over the past three months.
3. Using model data and customer profitability information, segment customers and develop personalized offers for them.

## Data Description
Data for the project is provided in several tables:

**market_file.csv** - table containing information about customer behavior on the site, communications with the customer, and product behavior:
- id — customer identifier in the corporate database  
- Покупательская активность — calculated customer activity class (target feature): "снизилась" or "прежний уровень"  
- Тип сервиса — level of service, e.g., "премиум" or "стандарт"  
- Разрешить сообщать — information on whether the customer agrees to receive additional product offers. Consent is given by the customer.  
- Маркет_актив_6_мес — average monthly value of the company's marketing communications per customer over the past 6 months. This indicates the number of emails, calls, ad displays, etc., the customer received.  
- Маркет_актив_тек_мес — number of marketing communications in the current month  
- Длительность — the number of days since the customer registered on the site  
- Акционные_покупки — the average monthly share of purchases on promotion out of total purchases over the last 6 months  
- Популярная_категория — the customer's most popular product category over the last 6 months  
- Средний_просмотр_категорий_за_визит — average number of categories viewed by the customer per visit in the last month  
- Неоплаченные_продукты_штук_квартал — total number of unpaid items in the cart over the last 3 months  
- Ошибка_сервиса — number of issues affecting the customer during site visits  
- Страниц_за_визит — average number of pages viewed by the customer per site visit over the last 3 months.  

**market_money.csv** - table with data on the revenue generated by the customer, i.e., the total amount spent by the customer during interactions with the site:
- id — customer identifier in the corporate database  
- Период — name of the period when revenue was recorded, e.g., 'текущий_месяц' or 'предыдущий_месяц'  
- Выручка — revenue amount for the period.  

**market_time.csv** - table with data on the time (in minutes) the customer spent on the site during the period:
- id — customer identifier in the corporate database  
- Период — name of the period when total time was recorded  
- минут — amount of time spent on the site in minutes.  

**money.csv** - table with data on the customer’s average monthly profit over the past 3 months (profit earned by the store from each customer’s purchases):
- id — customer identifier in the corporate database  
- Прибыль — profit amount.  

The specific steps for data analysis are provided in the notebook text.
