# SQL Practice

## Project Description
In this course project, you will work with a database that stores information about venture capital funds and investments in startup companies. This database is based on the [Startup Investments](https://www.kaggle.com/justinas/startup-investments) dataset published on the popular data science competition platform Kaggle.

Analyzing the investment market without preparation can be challenging. Before you start working with the database, familiarize yourself with important concepts that you will encounter in your work. Venture capital funds are financial organizations that can afford to take a high risk and invest in companies with innovative business ideas or developed new technologies, i.e., startups. The goal of venture capital funds is to achieve significant profits in the future that are many times greater than their expenses on investments in the company. If a startup becomes more valuable, the venture capital fund may receive a share in the company or a fixed percentage of its revenue.

To make the financing process less risky, it is divided into stages - rounds. A particular round depends on the level of development that the company has reached.

The early stages are pre-seed and seed rounds. The pre-seed round implies that the company as such does not yet exist and is in the idea stage. The next step is the seed round, which marks the growth of the project: the creators of the company develop a business model and attract investors.

If a company needs a mentor or coach, it attracts an angel investor. Angel investors are investors who, in addition to financial support, offer expert advice. This round is called angel.

When a startup becomes a company with a tested business model and starts generating revenue independently, there are more investment offers. This is the A round, followed by others: B, C, D - at these stages, the company actively develops and prepares for an IPO.

Sometimes, a venture round is distinguished - funding that could have come from a venture capital fund at any stage: initial or later.

In the investment data you will encounter mentions of rounds, but this project does not require you to understand their specifics better than any investor. The main thing is to understand how the data are structured.
It's best to start working with a new database by studying the ER-diagram.

Specific steps for analyzing data are described in the notebook text.

The following aspects of the theme **Basic SQL** have been worked out in this project:
- Data slices in SQL
- Aggregating functions. Grouping and sorting data
- Relationships between tables. Types of table joins
- Subqueries and temporary tables
- Database schemes and window functions
